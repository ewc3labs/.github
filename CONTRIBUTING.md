# Contributing to EWC3 Labs

Thanks for your interest! Here's the deal:

## 🧰 Code Contributions

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a branch (`fix-that-dumb-thing`)
3. Write code. Document. Test if you can.
4. Submit a pull request with clear reasoning, good comments, and bonus points for wit.

## 🐛 Bug Reports

Use the issue template. Add screenshots, logs, or interpretive dance as needed.

## 🧠 Feature Requests

Explain what and *why*. We love “Why didn’t they just…” ideas. That’s how half of this lab exists.

## 🐾 Style

- Clean, modular, documented
- Swear if you must, but be helpful
- Include the pugs where possible
