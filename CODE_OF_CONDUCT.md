# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in EWC3 Labs a harassment-free experience for everyone — including pugs and bulldogs.

We welcome contributions from anyone — whether you're a seasoned developer, a half-drunk tinkerer, or a bulldog with a soldering iron.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Respectful language, clear feedback, and a healthy dose of snark
- Constructive criticism wrapped in memes
- Welcoming humor, puns, and the occasional rant

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Gatekeeping
- Trollish, bigoted, or exclusionary conduct
- Trying to cancel the pug

## Enforcement

Violations may be handled with sarcastic gifs, private nudges, or ejection via high-velocity compressed air.

If you're being a jerk, stop it. If someone's being a jerk to you, [open an issue](https://github.com/ewc3labs) or email wilson@ewc3.com.
