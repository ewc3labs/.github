# 🧪 EWC3 Labs

Welcome to **EWC3 Labs** — a skunkworks of code, plastic, and canine gaseous emissions.

We build smarter tools, better mods, and deeply unnecessary upgrades. From 3D printing to automation scripts, parametric design to AI-assisted chaos.

We build things the way they *should* have been built the first time.

I'm Wilson — nerd-programmer-IT-systems guy, toolmaker, and creative engineer behind EWC3 Labs. I fix broken ideas out of spite and turn half-finished concepts into (hopefully) elegant, modular, open designs — because wrongness bothers me, and I have to make it work the way it should have in the first place. And iterate until my neurodivergent noggin is satisfied.

If you’ve ever said “Why didn’t they just…?” — I might have already done it, or at least thought about it really hard. This lab is where ideas grow legs, wag tails, and sometimes catch fire.

Your support helps keep the tools flowing — no paywalls, no closed STLs, no half-assed solutions. Just open-source, over-engineered weirdness made useful.

## 🧐 Philosophy

- **Design with intent** — Not just "cool," but useful, reusable, and open-source.
- **Toolify everything** — If we use it twice (or—who am I kidding—even once), it gets versioned and published.
- **No gatekeeping** — All skill levels welcome. Hackers, tinkerers, pug supervisors, bulldog lovers.
- **Snark is encouraged** — Humor, clarity, and style are features, not bugs.

## 🐾 Shop Gremlin Program

Yes, our canine lab assistants (pugs, bulldogs, and mutts alike) supervise QA and design meetings. No, they do not accept pull requests (but they *will* accept treats).
